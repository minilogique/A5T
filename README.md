- This version is made for M3 flatheads. You need to drill and tap the radiator for M3 bolts. Reasoning behind this is that the M2.5 bolts that I got with the toolhead were soft as shi-, so to properly fix that I just upped the size. 
- Flatheads instead of normals for maximizing plastic above the radiator, extruder might not sit flush with the top of the shroud but instead on the flatheads themselves - heating the bolt a bit when tightening can alleviate that.
- 2510 fan is bolted directly into plastic with M3 bolts, do not manhandle it. 4 bolts is perfect, 2 is enough.
- Two topmost bolts are either normal hexhead or flat hex M3x30 compared to what A4T/A5T extruder adapter used to use. They are not needed, but add considerable amount of rigidity.

> [!WARNING]
> A5T is not an easy print.

> [!NOTE]
> Use paint on supports for the duct enterances.

> [!WARNING]
> Only one M3x5 heat insert is used for the cowl, look the picture. Rest of them are melted into the fans like for Reaper toolhead and mounted with regular M3 bolts.
