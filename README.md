# A5T

+ **A5T is currently in testing; if you want to help out, ping me in Discord at @suzu00071 or join WKSuzuki Designs**

- This version is made for M3 flatheads. You need to drill and tap the radiator for M3 bolts. Reasoning behind this is that the M2.5 bolts that I got with the toolhead were soft as shi-, so to properly fix that I just upped the size. 
- Flatheads instead of normals for maximizing plastic above the radiator, extruder might not sit flush with the top of the shroud but instead on the flatheads themselves - heating the bolt a bit when tightening can alleviate that.
- 2510 fan is bolted directly into plastic with M3 bolts, do not manhandle it. 4 bolts is perfect, 2 is enough.

> A5T is not an easy print.

> [!NOTE]
> Use paint on supports for the duct enterances.

> [!WARNING]
> Only one M3x5 heat insert is used, look the picture. Rest of them are melted into the fans like for Reaper toolhead and mounted with regular M3 bolts.
